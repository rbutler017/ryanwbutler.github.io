<h1>Welcome to the personal webpage of Ryan W. Butler</h1>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sXwxKw1.jpeg" alt="Ryan Butler" align="right" width="150" height="204">
<p>Hello! I'm Ryan Butler, a first year MS student in RIT's astrophysical sciences and technology program.    
</p>
<p>I did my undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics at Alfred University. While their I spent a lot of 
    time at Stull Observatory observing (or attemempting to observe) exoplanet transits.
</p>
<p>I currently work on nearby young stars with Dr. Joel Kastner. These are stars within 100 pc of the sun and of ages less than 
    50 or so Myr. At present I am working on producing X-ray SEDs of several of candidate stars observed by Chandra as part of the 
    NYSCATS program.
</p>
<p>Below are buttons to take you to the other areas of this site. Have fun exploring.</p>
